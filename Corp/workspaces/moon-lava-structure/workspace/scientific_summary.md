# Scientific Summary

## Lunar Geology
- The Moon's surface is covered with regolith, a layer of loose, fragmented material.
- Beneath the regolith, the lunar crust is primarily composed of basaltic and anorthositic rocks.

## Lava Cave Formations
- Lunar lava tubes are formed by flowing lava that creates a solid crust, while the liquid interior continues to flow, leaving behind a hollow tube.
- These caves can be several kilometers long and provide natural protection from radiation and micrometeorite impacts.

## Potential Alien Biology
- Any potential alien life forms would need to withstand extreme temperatures, low gravity, and high radiation levels.
- Hypothetical alien organisms could utilize chemosynthesis, deriving energy from chemical reactions involving elements found in lunar rocks.
