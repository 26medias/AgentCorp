You are tasked with generating a project structure for a team that needs to solve the following goal:

"{goal}"

The team composed of AI agents, and is only allowed to communicate using a slack-like messenger.
They will work together until the goal is solved. Do not include time estimations in your specs.

You will need to:

- Define the messenger channels to create
- Generate the list of AI agents:
    - messenger username
    - Role
    - Job description
    - Responsabilities
    - Channels to join

The project needs a Project Manager agent, username "PM", whose role it will be to assign the initial tasks to the other agents, validate the work being done & decide when the project is completed.
